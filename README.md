### **Team Pattern Architecture**

#### **Core Components and Their Responsibilities**

- **State Models**
  - **Definition:**
    - Immutable data structures defined using tools like **Pydantic** in Python.
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Validate the structure and types of data upon instantiation.
    - Serve as the single source of truth for data representation.
    - Ensure data immutability to prevent unintended side-effects.
    - Facilitate consistent data handling across the system.
    - **Method Signatures:**
      - All methods (except those interacting with external libraries) **only** accept a **State Object** as a parameter.
      - The **State Object** must contain **all necessary fields** required for the method to perform its task.

- **Workers**
  - **Definition:**
    - Classes that perform specific, well-defined tasks within the workflow.
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Implemented as `@staticmethod` methods.
    - **Only** accept **one parameter**: a **State Object**.
    - **Do not** handle validations or error management directly.
    - **Do not** contain any branching logic (`if`, `else`, etc.).
    - Invoke **Error Components** to perform assertions, ensuring business rules are met.
    - Assume that all business rule conditions have been validated by **Delegators** via **Error Components**.
    - Perform data transformations and return new immutable **State Objects** without altering existing ones.

- **Fetchers**
  - **Definition:**
    - Classes responsible for retrieving data from external systems (e.g., APIs, databases).
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Instantiate and return **State Models**, relying on the models to validate data shape during creation.
    - **Do not** handle business rules or perform validations beyond constructing **State Models**.
    - **Do not** catch or handle errors; all errors bubble up to the caller.
    - Abstract the complexities of data access, providing a clean interface for data retrieval.
    - **Method Signatures:**
      - All methods (except those interacting with external libraries) **only** accept a **State Object** as a parameter.
      - The **State Object** must contain **all necessary fields** required for the method to perform its task.

- **Investigators**
  - **Definition:**
    - Pure functions that enforce business rules and domain-specific validations.
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Evaluate specific conditions based on the data.
    - Provide boolean responses indicating whether certain business rules are satisfied.
    - Remain stateless and side-effect-free.
    - **Used By:**
      - **Error Components** to perform assertions and raise exceptions when validations fail.
      - **Delegators** to perform additional business rule validations before orchestrating workflows.

- **Error Components**
  - **Definition:**
    - Classes that handle validation failures and other exceptions in a standardized manner.
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Contain **static methods** prefixed with `assert_` (e.g., `assert_valid_user_data`).
    - **Do not** maintain any state; operate solely on **State Objects**.
    - Utilize **Investigators** to evaluate business rules.
    - Raise standardized exceptions (e.g., `ValidationError`, `BusinessRuleError`) when validations fail.
    - Ensure consistent error handling across the system.
    - Are invoked **only by Workers** to perform necessary validations.
    - **Method Signatures:**
      - All methods (except those interacting with external libraries) **only** accept a **State Object** as a parameter.
      - The **State Object** must contain **all necessary fields** required for the method to perform its task.

- **Delegators**
  - **Definition:**
    - Classes that orchestrate workflows by coordinating between **Workers** and **Investigators**.
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Are decorated to enforce that they **only** contain a `process` method.
    - The `process` method **only** accepts a **State Object** as input and **only** returns a **State Object** as output.
    - **Do not** handle business logic or error management directly.
    - Utilize **Investigators** to perform business rule validations before delegating tasks to **Workers**.
    - **Do not** interact directly with **Error Components**; instead, rely on **Workers** to invoke them for assertions.
    - Allow exceptions raised by **Error Components** through **Workers** to propagate to the caller.
    - Are responsible for initiating and managing the sequence of task executions.

#### **Architectural Rules and Constraints**

- **Single Responsibility Principle**
  - Each component (**Worker**, **Fetcher**, **Delegator**, etc.) must have a clear, single responsibility.
  - Prevents overlap of functionalities and enhances maintainability.

- **Clear Separation of Concerns**
  - **State Models** handle data shape validations upon instantiation.
  - **Investigators** manage business rule validations.
  - **Delegators** manage workflow orchestration without embedding business logic or error handling.

- **Immutable State Management**
  - All **State Models** are immutable, ensuring data consistency throughout the workflow.
  - Workers and Delegators return new **State Objects** instead of modifying existing ones.

- **Standardized Method Signatures**
  - All methods across components (except those interacting with external libraries) **only** accept **State Objects** as parameters.
  - The **State Object** must contain **all necessary fields** for the method to perform its task.
  - Enforces consistency and simplifies tracking of data changes.

- **No Component Sharing Across Teams**
  - Components are not shared between different teams or Divisions.
  - Use **shared libraries** for common functionalities to maintain loose coupling.

#### **Error Handling**

- **Centralized Error Management**
  - **Error Components** are solely responsible for raising exceptions based on validations.
  - **Workers** delegate validation tasks to **Error Components** and **do not handle errors themselves**.
  - **Delegators** do not catch or manage errors; exceptions bubble up to the initiating process.

- **Standardized Exceptions**
  - Define specific exception classes (e.g., `ValidationError`, `BusinessRuleError`) to categorize errors.
  - Ensures uniform error responses and simplifies debugging.

#### **Dependency Injection and Enforcement**

- **Dependency Injection (DI)**
  - Utilize a DI Container to manage and inject dependencies into **Delegators**.
  - Ensures that **Delegators** receive the correct instances of **Workers** without manual wiring.

- **Decorators for Enforcement**
  - **@delegator**: Ensures the class only contains a `process` method with the correct signature.
  - **@worker**: Enforces that all methods are `@staticmethod`, accept only a **State Object**, and contain no branching logic.
  - **@error_component**: Ensures all methods start with `assert_`, are `@staticmethod`, and accept only a **State Object**.
  - These decorators perform checks at class definition time, preventing misconfigurations.

#### **Hierarchical Organization**

- **Divisions**
  - Collections of related **Delegators** handling specific business domains or functionalities.
  - Operate semi-independently, encapsulating their workflows and components.
  - Promote modularity and scalability within large systems.

- **Companies**
  - Top-level groupings encompassing multiple Divisions.
  - Represent broader business areas or departments.
  - Facilitate management of complex systems by defining clear boundaries and responsibilities.

#### **Best Practices**

1. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Maintain detailed documentation outlining responsibilities and usage guidelines for each component.
   - Facilitates understanding and correct implementation across teams.

2. **Rigorous Code Reviews**
   - Implement thorough code reviews to ensure adherence to the Team Pattern.
   - Detect and prevent violations of architectural rules early in the development cycle.

3. **Automated Testing**
   - Develop extensive unit and integration tests to validate component functionality and interactions.
   - Ensure that components behave as expected and maintain integrity throughout the workflow.

4. **Effective Communication**
   - Foster regular communication across Divisions to share best practices and updates on shared libraries.
   - Promote consistency and prevent redundant work.

5. **Continuous Monitoring and Refactoring**
   - Regularly audit the codebase to identify and address any emerging duplication or inconsistency issues.
   - Encourage a culture of continuous improvement and refactoring to maintain alignment with the pattern's principles.

#### **Common Pitfalls and Mitigations**

- **Duplicate Validation Logic Across Workers**
  - **Mitigation**: Centralize validation logic in **Error Components** and shared libraries to prevent duplication.

- **Inconsistent Error Handling**
  - **Mitigation**: Standardize exception classes and enforce their usage through **Error Components**.

- **Overlapping State Models**
  - **Mitigation**: Define and reuse **State Models** from a common library to maintain consistency across Divisions.

- **Branching Logic in Workers**
  - **Mitigation**: Enforce no branching through the **@worker** decorator and conduct thorough code reviews.

- **Divergent Library Versions**
  - **Mitigation**: Implement strict version control policies and centralized dependency management using tools like **pipenv** or **poetry**.

- **Incorrect Method Signatures**
  - **Mitigation**: Utilize decorators to enforce method signatures and perform regular code audits to ensure compliance.

- **Missing Dependencies in DI Container**
  - **Mitigation**: Ensure all required dependencies are registered in the DI Container before initializing Delegators.
