# Team Pattern Architectural Guide

## Introduction

Creating systems that are **maintainable**, **scalable**, and **reliable** is crucial in software development. As applications grow in complexity, adopting an architectural pattern that promotes clear separation of concerns, modularity, and efficient error handling becomes essential.

This guide introduces the **Team Pattern**—a comprehensive architectural framework designed to streamline the development process by defining distinct roles and responsibilities for various components within a system. By adhering to this pattern, development teams can ensure that each part of the application is focused, testable, and easy to maintain, ultimately leading to higher quality and more dependable software.

### Core Components

The Team Pattern is built around six key components, each with a specific role:

1. **Workers**: Handle the core business logic and data transformations, ensuring operations are executed correctly and efficiently. Workers are invoked exclusively by Delegators and must use Error class methods to validate data within the state they process.

2. **Fetchers**: Manage data access and retrieval from external systems, abstracting complexities and providing clean interfaces for data consumption. Fetchers return **State Objects** representing the extracted and validated data and utilize Error components for validation. They do not handle errors internally beyond validation.

3. **Delegators**: Orchestrate workflows by coordinating between Fetchers, Workers, and Investigators to manage complex business processes seamlessly. Delegators contain only a single `process` method, avoid direct data manipulation, do not manage state beyond the provided state objects, and rely on Investigators for decision-making without interacting with Error components.

4. **Investigators**: Enforce business rules and validations, maintaining data integrity by answering specific true/false questions about the data. They are pure functions that check only one condition per method.

5. **Error Components**: Provide an error handling framework, acting as type guards to validate state objects. They utilize Investigators to assess data and raise exceptions if validations fail. Delegators do not interact directly with Error components; instead, Workers and Fetchers handle validations and error assertions.

6. **State Models**: Define immutable data structures that traverse the system, ensuring consistency and reliability throughout the processing pipeline. They validate the shape of the data but remain agnostic to business rules, focusing solely on data structure integrity.

### Principles

The Team Pattern is grounded in several fundamental principles:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a distinct responsibility, promoting modularity and ease of maintenance.
- **Immutability**: State models are immutable, preventing unintended side-effects and ensuring consistent data flow.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic, data retrieval, validation, and error handling are handled by dedicated components.
- **Error Handling**: Errors are managed systematically, allowing for predictable and maintainable error propagation.
- **Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is maintained across all components, facilitating understanding and collaboration within the team.

### Benefits

Adopting the Team Pattern offers numerous advantages:

- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of responsibilities makes the system easier to maintain and extend.
- **Testability**: Modular components with single responsibilities are easier to test in isolation.
- **Scalability**: The pattern supports scalable architectures, allowing components to be scaled independently as needed.
- **Reliability**: Error handling and immutable state models enhance the system's reliability.
- **Clarity**: Comprehensive documentation and clear component boundaries improve overall system clarity, aiding both development and onboarding.

This guide delves into each component of the Team Pattern, providing examples of both compliant and non-compliant implementations to illustrate best practices and common pitfalls. By following the guidelines outlined here, development teams can leverage the Team Pattern to build high-quality, dependable software systems.

## Workers

**Workers** handle the core logic and transformations, ensuring that business operations are executed correctly and efficiently. They are exclusively invoked by Delegators and must utilize Error class methods to validate the data within the state they process. Workers can contain multiple independent methods, each responsible for a specific task. However, Worker methods must not call other Workers or their methods, maintaining independence and ensuring Workers are the final step in their respective processing pipelines.

### ❌ Bad Example (Non-Compliant Worker)

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Optional
from datetime import datetime

@dataclass
class UserState:
    email: str
    password: str
    created_at: Optional[datetime] = None

class BadUserRegistrationWorker:
    def process_registration(self, user_state: UserState) -> UserState:
        # ❌ Multiple responsibilities and no error assertions
        if not self.is_valid_email(user_state.email):
            raise ValueError("Invalid email format")

        # ❌ Direct data manipulation on a state object
        user_state.created_at = datetime.now()

        # ❌ Branching logic that should be in Investigators
        if len(user_state.password) < 8:
            return self.handle_weak_password(user_state)
        
        # ❌ Calling another worker (not allowed)
        password_worker = PasswordHashingWorker()
        hashed_password = password_worker.hash_password(user_state.password)
        
        return UserState(
            email=user_state.email.lower(),
            password=hashed_password,
            created_at=user_state.created_at
        )

    def is_valid_email(self, email: str) -> bool:
        # ❌ Worker containing multiple methods that aren't themselves workers (violation) 
        return '@' in email

    def handle_weak_password(self, user_state: UserState) -> UserState:
        # ❌ Throwing an exception within a worker (violation)
        raise ValueError("Password too weak")
```

### ✅ Good Example (Compliant Worker)

```python
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr

class UserState(BaseModel):
    email: EmailStr
    password: str
    created_at: Optional[datetime] = None
    
    class Config:
        frozen = True

class UserRegistrationInvestigator:
    """
    Investigator class to enforce business rules for user registration.
    """
    @staticmethod
    def is_valid_email(email: str) -> bool:
        return '@' in email

    @staticmethod
    def is_valid_password_length(password: str) -> bool:
        return len(password) >= 8

class UserRegistrationErrors:
    @staticmethod
    def raise_if_invalid_email(email: str) -> None:
        if not UserRegistrationInvestigator.is_valid_email(email):
            raise ValueError("Invalid email format")

    @staticmethod
    def raise_if_invalid_password_length(password: str) -> None:
        if not UserRegistrationInvestigator.is_valid_password_length(password):
            raise ValueError("Password too short")

class UserRegistrationWorker:
    """
    Processes user registration data by validating and transforming the input state.

    **Summary:**
        Handles the core transformation of user registration data, ensuring email 
        normalization and timestamp assignment.

    **Remarks:**
        - Designed to be invoked only by Delegators
        - Performs email normalization and timestamp assignment
        - Utilizes Error methods for validation
        - Maintains immutability by creating new state objects

    **Example:**
        ```python
        initial_state = UserState(
            email="User@Example.com",
            password="securepass123"
        )
        worker = UserRegistrationWorker()
        processed_state = worker.normalize_email(initial_state)
        processed_state = worker.assign_creation_timestamp(processed_state)
        worker.log_registration(processed_state)
        ```

    **Throws:**
        - `ValueError`: When email format is invalid
        - `ValueError`: When password length is insufficient

    **See:**
        - `UserState`
        - `UserRegistrationErrors`
        - `UserRegistrationInvestigator`

    **Parameters:**
        - `state (UserState)`: The initial user registration state containing email 
          and password information

    **Returns:**
        - `UserState`: A new immutable state object with normalized email and 
          timestamp
    """
    @staticmethod
    def normalize_email(state: UserState) -> UserState:
        """

        """
        print(f"User registered with email: {state.email} at {state.created_at}")
```

### Key Differences

1. **Declarative Method Names**: Instead of generic names like `process_registration`, methods are named based on their specific tasks, such as `normalize_email`, `assign_creation_timestamp`, and `log_registration`.
   
2. **Single Parameter (State Object)**: All Worker methods accept only the `UserState` object, ensuring that Workers do not depend on external parameters. Any additional data required must be encapsulated within the state object.
   
3. **Multiple Independent Methods**: The Worker contains multiple methods that handle distinct tasks without interdependencies or calls to other Workers.
   
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each method includes detailed docstrings explaining its purpose, parameters, returns, and potential exceptions.
   
5. **Error Handling**: Utilizes dedicated Error class methods that leverage Investigators for validation instead of performing direct validation.
   
6. **No Branching**: Avoids conditional logic within Worker methods, delegating decision-making to Investigators.
   
7. **Immutability**: Creates new state objects rather than modifying existing ones, maintaining immutability throughout the processing.
   
8. **No Worker Chaining**: Methods do not call other Workers, ensuring that Workers remain the final step in their respective processing pipelines.
   
9. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each method within the Worker handles its specific responsibility without overlapping functionalities.

## Fetchers

**Fetchers** manage data access and retrieval, abstracting the complexities of external systems and providing clean interfaces for data consumption. They utilize **Error Components** for validation and return **State Objects** representing the extracted and validated data. Fetchers do not handle errors internally beyond validation; any errors encountered during data fetching propagate up to be managed by the system executing the Delegator.

### ❌ Bad Implementation

```python
from typing import Dict, Optional
import requests

class BadUserFetcher:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_url = "https://api.example.com"
        self.cache = {}  # Breaking pattern: maintaining state

    def get_user(self, user_id: int) -> Dict:
        # No proper error handling - tries to handle errors internally
        try:
            # Breaking pattern: using cache/maintaining state
            if user_id in self.cache:
                return self.cache[user_id]
            
            response = requests.get(f"{self.base_url}/users/{user_id}")
            
            # Breaking pattern: handling errors instead of bubbling up
            if response.status_code != 200:
                return {"error": "User not found"}
            
            # Breaking pattern: direct data manipulation
            user_data = response.json()
            user_data["full_name"] = f"{user_data['first_name']} {user_data['last_name']}"
            
            # Breaking pattern: storing state
            self.cache[user_id] = user_data
            return user_data

        except Exception as e:
            # Breaking pattern: handling errors
            return {"error": str(e)}

    # Breaking pattern: multiple methods
    def update_user_cache(self, user_id: int) -> None:
        if user_id in self.cache:
            del self.cache[user_id]
```

#### Issues with the Incorrect Implementation:

1. **State Management**: Maintains internal state through caching, which violates the pattern's statelessness principle.
2. **Error Handling**: Handles errors internally instead of allowing them to propagate to be managed by higher-level components.
3. **Data Manipulation**: Directly manipulates fetched data, introducing business logic into Fetchers.
4. **Multiple Methods**: Contains additional utility methods beyond data fetching, violating single responsibility.

### ✅ Good Implementation (Compliant Fetcher)

        self.base_url = base_url

    async def get_user(self, user_id: int) -> UserState:
        """
        Retrieves user data from the API for a given user ID.

        **Summary:**
            Fetches user information from the external API service, validates it, and returns it as
            a validated `UserState` model.

        **Remarks:**
            - Performs a direct API call without caching.
            - All errors are propagated to the caller for handling.
            - Utilizes Error Components for validation.

        **Example:**
            ```python
            fetcher = UserFetcher("https://api.example.com")
            user_state = await fetcher.get_user(123)
            print(f"Found user: {user_state.username}")
            ```

        **Parameters:**
            - `user_id (int)`: The unique identifier of the user to retrieve

        **Returns:**
            - `UserState`: An immutable state object containing the validated user data

        **Throws:**
            - `requests.RequestException`: When the API request fails
            - `ValueError`: When fetched data fails validation checks
            - `ValidationError`: When the response data doesn't match the expected schema

        """
        response = requests.get(f"{self.base_url}/users/{user_id}")
        
        # Let the response error propagate up
        response.raise_for_status()
        
        # Parse JSON response
        data = response.json()
        
        # Validate presence of required fields

                is_active=data["is_active"]
            )
```

### Key Differences and Improvements in the Good Implementation

1. **State Object Return**:
   - **Bad**: Returns raw dictionaries with potential errors.
   - **Good**: Returns a **State Object** (`UserState`) that is immutable and validated.

2. **Assertions and Validations**:
   - **Good**: Utilizes **Error Components** (`FetcherErrors`) and **Investigators** (`FetcherInvestigator`) to validate fetched data before converting it into a state object.
   - **Error Handling**: Raises exceptions (`ValueError`, `ValidationError`) directly within the Fetcher when validations fail, allowing higher-level components to handle them appropriately.

3. **Immutable State Models**:
   - **Good**: Uses Pydantic's `BaseModel` with `frozen=True` to ensure immutability, preventing unintended side-effects.

4. **Clear Separation of Concerns**:
   - **Good**: Fetchers focus solely on data retrieval and initial validation, leaving business logic to Workers and Investigators.

5. **Comprehensive Documentation**:
   - **Good**: Detailed docstrings explaining the purpose, parameters, returns, and exceptions of each method.

6. **No Internal State Management**:
   - **Good**: Does not maintain internal caches or states, adhering to the statelessness principle of Fetchers.

7. **Error Propagation**:
   - **Good**: Allows errors to propagate up, enabling centralized error handling at the system level.

8. **Data Conversion and Validation**:
   - **Good**: Converts raw fetched data into structured `UserState` objects, ensuring data integrity through type validation and explicit field definitions.

### Example Usage in a Delegator

To illustrate how the compliant Fetcher integrates within the overall architecture, here's how it can be utilized within a Delegator:

```python
class UserDelegator:
    def __init__(
        self,
        user_fetcher: UserFetcher,
        email_worker: EmailWorker,
        verification_worker: VerificationWorker,
        email_investigator: EmailInvestigator
    ):
        self.user_fetcher = user_fetcher
        self.email_worker = email_worker
        self.verification_worker = verification_worker
        self.email_investigator = email_investigator

    async def process(self, user_id: int) -> UserState:
        """
        Orchestrates the user verification workflow.

        **Parameters:**
            - `user_id (int)`: The unique identifier of the user.

        **Returns:**
            - `UserState`: The final user state after processing.
        """
        # Fetch user data using Fetcher
        user_state = await self.user_fetcher.get_user(user_id)
        
        # Use Worker to normalize email
        state_with_normalized_email = self.email_worker.normalize_email(user_state)
        
        # Use Investigator to make decisions
        if self.email_investigator.is_eligible_for_verification(state_with_normalized_email):
            # Use Worker to handle verification
            final_state = self.verification_worker.verify_user_email(state_with_normalized_email)
        else:
            final_state = state_with_normalized_email
            
        return final_state
```

**Note:** Since Fetchers now return state objects, Delegators can directly work with these validated and immutable objects, ensuring that downstream Workers receive consistent and reliable data.

---

## Delegators

**Delegators** orchestrate the workflow by coordinating between Fetchers, Workers, and Investigators to manage complex business processes seamlessly. They contain only a single `process` method, avoid direct data manipulation, do not manage state beyond the provided state objects, and rely on Investigators for decision-making without interacting with Error components.

### ❌ Incorrect Delegator Implementation

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Optional

@dataclass
class UserState:
    user_id: str
    email: Optional[str] = None
    is_verified: bool = False

class BadUserDelegator:
    def process(self, user_id: str) -> UserState:
        # ❌ Direct data manipulation instead of using Workers
        user_state = UserState(user_id=user_id)
        
        # ❌ Direct error handling instead of letting errors bubble up
        try:
            user_data = self.fetch_user_data(user_id)
            user_state.email = user_data.get('email')
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error fetching user data: {e}")
            return user_state

        # ❌ Direct business logic instead of using Investigators
        if '@' in user_state.email:
            user_state.is_verified = True
        
        # ❌ Direct state modification instead of creating new state
        self.update_user_status(user_state)
        
        return user_state

    def fetch_user_data(self, user_id: str) -> dict:
        # Direct data fetching instead of using Fetchers
        return {"email": "user@example.com"}

    def update_user_status(self, state: UserState) -> None:
        # Direct database update
        pass
```

#### Issues with the Incorrect Implementation:

1. **Multiple Methods Beyond `process`**: Contains methods like `fetch_user_data` and `update_user_status` which violate the single responsibility principle.
2. **Direct Data Manipulation**: Manipulates `UserState` directly instead of delegating to Workers.
3. **Error Handling**: Implements error handling within the Delegator instead of allowing errors to bubble up.
4. **Business Logic**: Contains business logic directly instead of utilizing Investigators.
5. **State Modification**: Modifies state directly instead of creating new immutable states.
6. **Data Fetching**: Fetches data directly instead of using Fetchers.

### ✅ Correct Delegator Implementation

```python

### Key Differences

1. **Single `process` Method**: Maintains a single entry point for orchestration logic.
   
2. **Dependencies Injected Through Constructor**: Enhances testability and flexibility by injecting dependencies.
   
3. **No Direct Data Manipulation**: Utilizes Workers and Fetchers for data processing instead of manipulating state directly within the Delegator.
   
4. **Error Propagation**: Allows errors to bubble up without handling them internally, adhering to the principle that Delegators should not manage errors directly.
   
5. **Uses Investigators for Decision-Making**: Delegates business logic decisions to Investigators, keeping Delegators focused on orchestration.
   
6. **Immutable State**: Works with immutable state objects to ensure consistency.
   
7. **Multiple Independent Worker Methods**: Each Worker method performs a distinct, independent task without interdependencies or calls to other Workers.
   
8. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each component handles its specific responsibility without overlapping functionalities.

### Supporting Components

For completeness, here’s how the supporting components might look:

```python
class UserFetcher:
    async def get_user(self, user_id: int) -> UserState:
        # Fetch user data from external system
        # Example implementation
        # In a real scenario, this would perform an API call or database query
        fetched_data = {
            "id": user_id,
            "email": "User@Example.com",
            "username": "exampleuser",
            "created_at": "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z",
            "is_active": True
        }
        
        # Validate and convert fetched data to UserState
        FetcherErrors.raise_if_missing_fields(fetched_data)
        FetcherErrors.raise_if_invalid_email(fetched_data.get("email", ""))
        
        return UserState(
           user_id=UUID(int=fetched_data["id"]),  # Assuming UUID based on ID
           email=fetched_data["email"],
           is_verified=False,
           created_at=datetime.fromisoformat(fetched_data["created_at"].replace("Z", "+00:00"))
         )

class EmailWorker:
    def normalize_email(self, state: UserState) -> UserState:
        # Normalize email and return new state
        return UserState(
            user_id=state.user_id,
            email=state.email.lower() if state.email else None,
            is_verified=state.is_verified,
            created_at=state.created_at
        )

class VerificationWorker:
    def verify_user_email(self, state: UserState) -> UserState:
        # Verify email and return new state
        return UserState(
            user_id=state.user_id,
            email=state.email,
            is_verified=True,
            created_at=state.created_at
        )

class EmailInvestigator:
    def is_eligible_for_verification(self, state: UserState) -> bool:
        # Single condition check
        return state.email is not None and '@' in state.email
```

## Investigators

**Investigators** enforce business rules and validations, maintaining data integrity by answering specific true/false questions about the data. They are pure functions that check only one condition per method.

### ❌ Incorrect Implementation

```python
class OrderInvestigator:
    @staticmethod
    def is_order_valid(order_state: OrderState) -> bool:
        # INCORRECT: Multiple if/then statements
        if order_state.total_amount <= 0:
            return False
        
        if order_state.items_count == 0:
            return False
            
        if order_state.delivery_address is None:
            return False
            
        return True

    @staticmethod
    def can_process_order(order_state: OrderState) -> bool:
        # INCORRECT: Multiple conditions with multiple if/then statements
        if order_state.status == "PENDING":
            return True

        if order_state.name == 'SomeName':
            return True
            
        return False
```

The above implementation is incorrect because:

1. **Multiple If/Then Statements**: Uses several conditional checks within a single method instead of consolidating them.
2. **Split Logic**: Splits related logic across multiple decision points rather than consolidating it.

### ✅ Correct Implementation

```python
class OrderInvestigator:
    @staticmethod
    def has_positive_total_amount(order_state: OrderState) -> bool:
        # Checks if the total amount is positive
        return order_state.total_amount > 0

    @staticmethod
    def has_items(order_state: OrderState) -> bool:
        # Checks if there is at least one item
        return order_state.items_count > 0

    @staticmethod
    def has_delivery_address(order_state: OrderState) -> bool:
        # Checks if the delivery address is provided
        return order_state.delivery_address is not None

    @staticmethod
    def is_order_pending(order_state: OrderState) -> bool:
        # Checks if the order status is pending
        return order_state.status == "PENDING"

    @staticmethod
    def is_payment_verified(order_state: OrderState) -> bool:
        # Checks if the payment is verified
        return order_state.payment_verified

    @staticmethod
    def has_fragile_items(order_state: OrderState) -> bool:
        # Checks if the order has fragile items
        return order_state.has_fragile_items

    @staticmethod
    def requires_refrigeration(order_state: OrderState) -> bool:
        # Checks if the order requires refrigeration
        return order_state.requires_refrigeration

    @staticmethod
    def is_oversized(order_state: OrderState) -> bool:
        # Checks if the order is oversized
        return order_state.is_oversized
```

### Key Differences

1. **Single Truth Evaluation**: Each method evaluates exactly one truth condition, even if it involves multiple factors.
2. **Direct Boolean Returns**: Returns boolean expressions directly without using if/then control flow.
3. **Clarity of Purpose**: Each method has a clear, single responsibility for checking one specific aspect of the order.
4. **No Control Flow**: Avoids using control flow statements (`if/then`) and relies on boolean operations (`and`, `or`) to combine conditions.

**Remember:**

- It's acceptable to have multiple conditions in a single boolean expression.
- Avoid multiple if/then statements or nested structures.
- Each method should evaluate exactly one truth condition.
- Express logic as a single boolean expression, even if it’s complex.

This approach ensures that Investigators remain focused, maintainable, and easy to test while allowing for complex validation logic when necessary.

---

## Error Components

**Error Components** provide an error handling framework, acting as type guards to validate state objects. They utilize **Investigators** to assess data and raise exceptions if validations fail. Delegators do not interact directly with Error components; instead, Workers and Fetchers handle validations and error assertions.

### ❌ Incorrect Implementation

```python
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel

    user_id: str
    email: str

    """
    @staticmethod
    def validate_user(user: UserState) -> None:
        # ❌ Multiple conditions in one method
        # ❌ Direct business logic without using Investigators
        # ❌ Mixing different types of validations
        if not user.is_active:
            raise ValueError("User is not active")
        
        if user.age < 18:
            raise ValueError("User must be 18 or older")
        
        if not user.email or '@' not in user.email:
            raise ValueError("Invalid email format")

    @staticmethod
    def check_user_eligibility(user: UserState, premium_feature: bool = False) -> bool:
        # ❌ Returns boolean instead of raising assertion
        # ❌ Contains business logic that should be in an Investigator
        # ❌ Handles multiple conditions
        return user.is_active and user.age >= 21 and premium_feature

    def process_user(self, user: UserState) -> None:
        # ❌ Contains processing logic that should be in a Worker
        # ❌ Modifies state
        # ❌ Non-static method
        self.validate_user(user)
        # ... more processing
```

        """
        if not UserInvestigator.has_valid_email(user):
            raise ValueError("Invalid email format")

# Example usage in a Worker

        UserError.raise_if_invalid_email(user)
        
        # Continue with processing...
        return user
```

### Key Differences and Explanations

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - **Incorrect**: Mixes business logic, validation, and processing within the Error class.
   - **Correct**: Separates business rule validation into `UserInvestigator` and assertion methods into `UserError`.

2. **Single Responsibility**:
   - **Incorrect**: Methods perform multiple validations and contain processing logic.
   - **Correct**: Each assertion method focuses on a single validation, leveraging Investigators for business rules.

3. **Pure Functions**:
   - **Incorrect**: Includes state modification and non-static methods.
   - **Correct**: Uses only static methods without modifying state.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - **Incorrect**: Mixes boolean returns with assertions.
   - **Correct**: Consistently uses methods that raise exceptions directly.

5. **Business Logic Location**:
   - **Incorrect**: Embeds business logic directly in the Error class.
   - **Correct**: Delegates business logic to Investigators.

6. **Method Structure**:
   - **Incorrect**: Methods perform multiple tasks.
   - **Correct**: Methods are focused and single-purpose.

### Usage Example

```python
# Example Delegator using the correct implementation
class UserDelegator:
    def __init__(
        self,
        user_fetcher: UserFetcher,
        email_worker: EmailWorker,
        verification_worker: VerificationWorker,
        email_investigator: EmailInvestigator
    ):
        self.user_fetcher = user_fetcher
        self.email_worker = email_worker
        self.verification_worker = verification_worker
        self.email_investigator = email_investigator

    async def process(self, user_id: int) -> UserState:
        """
        Orchestrates the user verification workflow.

        **Parameters:**
            - `user_id (int)`: The unique identifier of the user.

        **Returns:**
            - `UserState`: The final user state after processing.
        """
        # Fetch user data using Fetcher
        user_state = await self.user_fetcher.get_user(user_id)
            
        # Use Worker to normalize email
        state_with_normalized_email = self.email_worker.normalize_email(user_state)
            
        # Use Investigator to make decisions
        if self.email_investigator.is_eligible_for_verification(state_with_normalized_email):
            # Use Worker to handle verification
            final_state = self.verification_worker.verify_user_email(state_with_normalized_email)
        else:
            final_state = state_with_normalized_email
                
         return final_state
```

**Note:** The Delegator remains focused on orchestrating the workflow without handling errors directly. Errors raised by Workers or Fetchers propagate up to be managed by the system executing the Delegator.

---

## State Models

**State Models** define immutable data structures that traverse the system, ensuring consistency and reliability throughout the processing pipeline. They validate the shape of the data but remain agnostic to business rules, focusing solely on data structure integrity.

### ❌ Incorrect Implementation

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional, List

class UserProfileState(BaseModel):
    user_id: str
    email: str
    name: str
    age: int
    subscription_status: str
    last_login: datetime
    preferences: dict

    # ❌ Contains business logic
    def is_premium_user(self) -> bool:
        return self.subscription_status == "premium"

    # ❌ Modifies state
    def update_last_login(self):
        self.last_login = datetime.now()

    # ❌ Validates business rules
    def validate_age(self):
        if self.age < 18:
            raise ValueError("User must be 18 or older")

    # ❌ Complex data transformation
    def get_formatted_preferences(self) -> dict:
        formatted = {}
        for key, value in self.preferences.items():
            formatted[key.lower()] = str(value).upper()
        return formatted

    # ❌ External system interaction
    async def sync_with_database(self, db_connection):
        await db_connection.update_user(self.dict())
```

#### Problems with This Implementation:

1. **Business Logic**: Contains methods like `is_premium_user` that enforce business rules.
2. **State Modification**: Allows modification of state through methods like `update_last_login`.
3. **Business Rule Validation**: Implements validation logic directly within the model.
4. **Data Transformation**: Performs data transformations with methods like `get_formatted_preferences`.
5. **External System Interaction**: Interacts with external systems using methods like `sync_with_database`.
6. **Immutability**: Lacks `frozen=True`, making the model mutable.

### ✅ Correct Implementation

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, EmailStr
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Dict, Literal, Optional
from uuid import UUID

class UserProfileState(BaseModel):
    """
    Represents the immutable state of a user profile.
    Only validates data structure, not business rules.
    """
    user_id: UUID
    email: EmailStr
    name: str
    age: int = Field(ge=0)  # ✅ Structural validation only
    subscription_status: Literal["free", "premium", "enterprise"]
    last_login: datetime
    preferences: Dict[str, str]
    created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)
    version: int = 1

    class Config:
        frozen = True  # ✅ Ensures immutability
        json_encoders = {
            UUID: str,
            datetime: lambda v: v.isoformat()
        }
        
        # ✅ Optional: Custom error messages for structural validation
        error_msg_templates = {
            'type_error.integer': 'age must be a valid integer',
            'value_error.missing': '{field_name} is required'
        }

    class Meta:
        description = "Represents user profile data at a specific point in time"
        version = "1.0.0"
```

### Key Aspects of the Correct Implementation

1. **Immutability**:
   - Utilizes `frozen=True` in Pydantic models to prevent state modification after creation.
   - No methods are included that attempt to modify the state.
   
2. **Structure-Only Validation**:
   - Employs Pydantic's `Field` for basic type and range validation.
   - Does not include business rule validations.
   - Uses precise types with `Literal` for enum-like fields.
   
3. **Clear Purpose**:
   - Represents data structure without embedding business logic or transformations.
   - Includes metadata such as `created_at` and `version` for tracking.
   
4. **No Business Logic**:
   - Excludes methods for business rules, transformations, or external interactions.

### Usage Example

```python
# Creating a new state instance
from uuid import uuid4

# ✅ Correct usage
    profile = UserProfileState(
        user_id=uuid4(),
        email="user@example.com",
        name="John Doe",
        age=25,
        subscription_status="premium",
        last_login=datetime.utcnow(),
        preferences={"theme": "dark", "language": "en"}
    )

# ✅ Creating a new state from an existing one
new_profile = UserProfileState(
    **profile.dict(),
    last_login=datetime.utcnow(),
    version=profile.version + 1
)

# ❌ This would raise an error due to immutability
# profile.age = 26  # FrozenInstanceError

# ❌ Business logic belongs in Investigators, not here
# if profile.subscription_status == "premium":  # Should be in an Investigator class
```

### Validation Example (Where It Should Go)

```python
# ✅ This belongs in an Investigator class
class UserProfileInvestigator:
    @staticmethod
    def is_premium_user(state: UserProfileState) -> bool:
        return state.subscription_status == "premium"

    @staticmethod
    def is_adult(state: UserProfileState) -> bool:
        return state.age >= 18

# ✅ This belongs in an Error class
class UserProfileError:
    @staticmethod
    def raise_if_invalid_age(state: UserProfileState) -> None:
        if not UserProfileInvestigator.is_adult(state):
            raise ValueError(f"User must be 18 or older. Current age: {state.age}")

    @staticmethod
    def raise_if_not_premium(state: UserProfileState) -> None:
        if not UserProfileInvestigator.is_premium_user(state):
            raise ValueError("User is not a premium member")

# ✅ This belongs in a Worker class
class UserProfileWorker:
    @staticmethod
    def format_preferences(state: UserProfileState) -> UserProfileState:
        formatted_prefs = {
            k.lower(): str(v).upper() 
            for k, v in state.preferences.items()
        }
        return UserProfileState(
            **state.dict(),
            preferences=formatted_prefs,
            version=state.version + 1
        )
```

The correct implementation ensures that the **State** class remains focused solely on data structure and validation, leaving business logic, transformations, and other concerns to their respective components in the architecture.

## Hierarchical Groupings: Divisions and Companies

To manage complexity in large-scale applications, it's beneficial to organize Delegators into hierarchical groups. This structure promotes modularity, enhances maintainability, and facilitates clear boundaries between different parts of the system.

### Overview

To enhance the **Team Pattern**, we introduce hierarchical groupings:

- **Delegator**: The foundational unit responsible for orchestrating workflows.
  
- **Division**: A collection of related Delegators that handle specific business domains or functionalities.
  
- **Company**: A higher-level grouping that encompasses multiple Divisions, representing broader business areas or departments.

### Why Hierarchical Groupings?

1. **Scalability**: As applications grow, organizing Delegators into Divisions and Companies prevents the system from becoming monolithic and unmanageable.
   
2. **Modularity**: Clear boundaries between Divisions and Companies allow teams to work independently on different parts of the system.
   
3. **Maintainability**: Isolated groups reduce the risk of unintended side-effects when making changes, simplifying debugging and enhancements.
   
4. **Reusability**: Common workflows within a Division can be reused across different Companies or modules.

### Terminology Alternatives

If you prefer terminology that's more aligned with software engineering practices, consider the following alternatives:

- **Divisions → Modules/Components**
  
- **Companies → Services/Microservices/Systems**

Choose the terminology that best fits your organization's culture and the specific context of your application architecture. For this guide, we'll proceed with **Divisions** and **Companies** as hierarchical groupings within the Team Pattern, ensuring clarity and consistency.

## Implementing Divisions and Companies

### Structure Overview

```
Company
│
├── Division A
│   ├── Delegator A1
│   ├── Delegator A2
│   └── ...
│
├── Division B
│   ├── Delegator B1
│   ├── Delegator B2
│   └── ...
│
└── Division C
    ├── Delegator C1
    ├── Delegator C2
    └── ...
```

### Defining Divisions

A **Division** groups together Delegators that share a common business domain or functionality. Each Division operates semi-independently, encapsulating its workflows and related components.

#### Example: E-commerce System

- **Company**: E-commerce Platform
  - **Division A**: User Management
    - **Delegator A1**: User Registration
    - **Delegator A2**: User Authentication
  - **Division B**: Product Catalog
    - **Delegator B1**: Product Listing
    - **Delegator B2**: Product Search
  - **Division C**: Order Processing
    - **Delegator C1**: Order Creation
    - **Delegator C2**: Payment Processing

### Defining Companies

A **Company** serves as the top-level grouping that encapsulates all Divisions. It represents the entire application or a major subsystem within a larger ecosystem.

#### Example: Multinational Corporation Software

- **Company**: Global Operations System
  - **Division A**: HR Management
    - **Delegator A1**: Employee Onboarding
    - **Delegator A2**: Payroll Processing
  - **Division B**: Finance
    - **Delegator B1**: Budgeting
    - **Delegator B2**: Expense Tracking
  - **Division C**: Sales
    - **Delegator C1**: Lead Management
    - **Delegator C2**: Sales Analytics

## Detailed Implementation

### Division-Level Organization

Each **Division** contains multiple **Delegators** that handle specific workflows. Here's how you can structure them:

#### User Management Division Example

```python
# user_management/user_registration_delegator.py

from uuid import UUID
from pydantic import BaseModel
from workers import UserRegistrationWorker
from fetchers import UserFetcher
from errors import UserRegistrationErrors

class UserRegistrationState(BaseModel):
    user_id: UUID
    email: str
    password: str
    created_at: datetime

    class Config:
        frozen = True

class UserRegistrationDelegator:
    def __init__(self, worker: UserRegistrationWorker, fetcher: UserFetcher):
        self.worker = worker
        self.fetcher = fetcher

    async def process_registration(self, user_data: dict) -> UserRegistrationState:
        # Create initial state
        initial_state = UserRegistrationState(**user_data)

        # Use Worker to normalize email
        normalized_state = self.worker.normalize_email(initial_state)

        # Additional processing steps can be chained here
        final_state = self.worker.assign_creation_timestamp(normalized_state)

        return final_state
```

#### Product Catalog Division Example

```python
# product_catalog/product_listing_delegator.py

from pydantic import BaseModel
from workers import ProductListingWorker
from fetchers import ProductFetcher
from errors import ProductListingErrors

class ProductListingState(BaseModel):
    product_id: UUID
    name: str
    description: str
    price: float
    available_stock: int

    class Config:
        frozen = True

class ProductListingDelegator:
    def __init__(self, worker: ProductListingWorker, fetcher: ProductFetcher):
        self.worker = worker
        self.fetcher = fetcher

    async def list_products(self, criteria: dict) -> list[ProductListingState]:
        # Fetch product data using Fetcher
        products = await self.fetcher.get_products(criteria)

        # Use Worker to format product data
        formatted_products = [self.worker.format_product(product) for product in products]

        return formatted_products
```

### Company-Level Organization

At the **Company** level, you aggregate all Divisions, allowing for higher-level orchestration if necessary.

#### E-commerce Platform Company Example

```python
# ecommerce_platform/company.py

from divisions.user_management.user_registration_delegator import UserRegistrationDelegator
from divisions.user_management.user_authentication_delegator import UserAuthenticationDelegator
from divisions.product_catalog.product_listing_delegator import ProductListingDelegator
from divisions.product_catalog.product_search_delegator import ProductSearchDelegator
from divisions.order_processing.order_creation_delegator import OrderCreationDelegator
from divisions.order_processing.payment_processing_delegator import PaymentProcessingDelegator

class ECommerceCompany:
    def __init__(
        self,
        user_registration_delegator: UserRegistrationDelegator,
        user_authentication_delegator: UserAuthenticationDelegator,
        product_listing_delegator: ProductListingDelegator,
        product_search_delegator: ProductSearchDelegator,
        order_creation_delegator: OrderCreationDelegator,
        payment_processing_delegator: PaymentProcessingDelegator
    ):
        self.user_registration_delegator = user_registration_delegator
        self.user_authentication_delegator = user_authentication_delegator
        self.product_listing_delegator = product_listing_delegator
        self.product_search_delegator = product_search_delegator
        self.order_creation_delegator = order_creation_delegator
        self.payment_processing_delegator = payment_processing_delegator

    async def register_user(self, user_data: dict) -> UserRegistrationState:
        return await self.user_registration_delegator.process_registration(user_data)

    async def authenticate_user(self, credentials: dict) -> UserAuthenticationState:
        return await self.user_authentication_delegator.process_authentication(credentials)

    async def list_products(self, criteria: dict) -> list[ProductListingState]:
        return await self.product_listing_delegator.list_products(criteria)

    async def search_products(self, query: str) -> list[ProductSearchState]:
        return await self.product_search_delegator.search_products(query)

    async def create_order(self, order_data: dict) -> OrderCreationState:
        return await self.order_creation_delegator.create_order(order_data)

    async def process_payment(self, payment_data: dict) -> PaymentProcessingState:
        return await self.payment_processing_delegator.process_payment(payment_data)
```

### Benefits of Hierarchical Groupings

- **Isolation**: Changes within a Division have minimal impact on other Divisions, enhancing system robustness.
  
- **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can manage separate Divisions or Companies, fostering specialization and efficient workflow management.
  
- **Clear Boundaries**: Establishing clear boundaries helps in defining ownership, responsibilities, and reduces the likelihood of cross-cutting concerns causing conflicts.
  
- **Enhanced Reusability**: Common functionalities within a Division can be reused across different parts of the system or even different Companies if needed.

### Best Practices

- **Consistent Naming**: Ensure that Divisions and Companies are named intuitively to reflect their responsibilities and domains.
  
- **Loose Coupling**: Divisions should interact through well-defined interfaces to minimize dependencies and facilitate independent evolution.
  
- **Clear Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for each Division and Company, outlining their responsibilities, workflows, and interactions.
  
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Implement infrastructure that supports scaling Divisions and Companies independently, such as microservices architectures or modular monoliths.
  
- **Dependency Management**: Use dependency injection and inversion of control principles to manage dependencies between Divisions and Companies effectively.

## Integrating Hierarchical Groupings into the Team Pattern

### Maintaining Separation of Concerns

Even with hierarchical groupings, it's crucial to maintain the core principles of the Team Pattern:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each Delegator, Division, and Company should have a clear, distinct purpose.
  
- **Immutability**: State Models remain immutable, ensuring consistency across the system.
  
- **Error Handling**: Error Components continue to handle validations and exceptions without being tightly coupled to other components.

### Communication Between Levels

- **Delegators within Divisions** interact with their respective Workers, Fetchers, Investigators, and Error Components.
  
- **Divisions within Companies** interact through the Company’s interface, which may invoke Delegators from different Divisions as needed.
  
- **Companies** may interact with external systems, APIs, or other Companies through well-defined interfaces or service contracts.

### Example Workflow Across Hierarchical Levels

**Scenario**: A user registers, browses products, and places an order.

1. **User Registration**:
   - **Company** invokes `UserRegistrationDelegator` in the **User Management Division**.
   - **Delegator** uses **Fetcher** to retrieve necessary data (if any) and **Worker** to process registration.
   - **Error Components** validate input data and throw exceptions if validations fail.

2. **Product Browsing**:
   - **Company** invokes `ProductListingDelegator` in the **Product Catalog Division**.
   - **Delegator** uses **Fetcher** to retrieve product data and **Worker** to format/display products.
   - **Error Components** ensure data integrity.

3. **Order Creation**:
   - **Company** invokes `OrderCreationDelegator` in the **Order Processing Division**.
   - **Delegator** coordinates with **Fetchers** to retrieve user and product data, uses **Workers** to create the order.
   - **Error Components** validate order details.

4. **Payment Processing**:
   - **Company** invokes `PaymentProcessingDelegator` in the **Order Processing Division**.
   - **Delegator** uses **Fetcher** to retrieve payment information, **Worker** to process payment.
   - **Error Components** validate payment data.

Each step maintains clear boundaries, with Delegators orchestrating workflows within their Divisions and Companies managing overarching processes.

```
Company: E-Commerce Platform
│
├── Division A: User Management
│   ├── Delegator A1: User Registration
│   ├── Delegator A2: User Authentication
│   └── ...
│
├── Division B: Product Catalog
│   ├── Delegator B1: Product Listing
│   ├── Delegator B2: Product Search
│   └── ...
│
└── Division C: Order Processing
    ├── Delegator C1: Order Creation
    ├── Delegator C2: Payment Processing
    └── ...
```

This structure promotes a clear and organized architecture, facilitating easier navigation, maintenance, and scalability.

## FAQ

### What is the Team Pattern?

The **Team Pattern** is an architectural framework that defines distinct roles and responsibilities for various components within a system. It emphasizes separation of concerns, immutability, and systematic error handling to build maintainable, scalable, and reliable software systems.

### What are the core components of the Team Pattern?

The core components include:

1. **Workers**: Handle business logic and data transformations.
2. **Fetchers**: Manage data retrieval from external systems.
3. **Delegators**: Orchestrate workflows by coordinating Fetchers, Workers, and Investigators.
4. **Investigators**: Enforce business rules and validations.
5. **Error Components**: Provide a framework for error handling and validation.
6. **State Models**: Define immutable data structures for data consistency.

### How do Divisions and Companies fit into the Team Pattern?

**Divisions** and **Companies** are hierarchical groupings introduced to manage complexity in large-scale applications. 

- **Divisions**: Group related Delegators that handle specific business domains or functionalities.
- **Companies**: Encompass multiple Divisions, representing broader business areas or departments.

This hierarchical structure promotes modularity, maintainability, and scalability by establishing clear boundaries and responsibilities.

### Why is immutability important in the Team Pattern?

Immutability ensures that state objects cannot be altered after creation, preventing unintended side-effects and maintaining consistent data flow throughout the system. This leads to more predictable and reliable software behavior.

### How does the Team Pattern enhance testability?

By enforcing single responsibility and separation of concerns, each component can be tested in isolation. Immutable State Models and pure Investigators further simplify testing by removing dependencies on external states or side-effects.

### Can the Team Pattern be integrated with other architectural styles?

Yes, the Team Pattern can complement other architectural styles like Microservices or Modular Monoliths. Its emphasis on clear component roles and responsibilities aligns well with distributed and modular systems.

### What are common pitfalls when implementing the Team Pattern?

- **Violation of Single Responsibility**: Components handling multiple responsibilities can lead to tightly coupled and hard-to-maintain code.
- **State Mutation**: Allowing state objects to be mutable undermines data consistency and reliability.
- **Improper Error Handling**: Not utilizing Error Components effectively can result in unmanageable and inconsistent error propagation.
- **Overcomplicating Hierarchical Groupings**: Introducing too many layers or unnecessary groupings can add complexity without substantial benefits.

### How should errors be managed in the Team Pattern?

Errors should be handled systematically using **Error Components** that validate state objects and raise exceptions when validations fail. Delegators should not handle errors directly; instead, they should allow errors from Workers and Fetchers to propagate up for centralized handling.

### What is the role of documentation in the Team Pattern?

Clear and comprehensive documentation is vital for understanding component responsibilities, workflows, and interactions. It facilitates collaboration, onboarding, and maintenance by providing a reference for how each part of the system operates within the architectural framework.

---

## Conclusion

This architectural pattern promotes a **clean**, **maintainable**, and **scalable** codebase by enforcing clear boundaries and responsibilities across different components. Adhering to best practices such as **immutability**, **single responsibility**, and **error handling** ensures that each part of the system is **predictable**, **testable**, and **easy to reason about**.
